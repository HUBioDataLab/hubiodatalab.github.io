I'm a PhD candidate in Bioinformatics at Hacettepe University. With a BSc in Molecular Biology and Genetics from Uludag University and an MSc in Bioinformatics from Hacettepe, I've built a foundation in both experimental biology and computational methods, which I now integrate into my research.

My current focus is on biological knowledge graphs and graph learning approaches for modeling biological systems and predicting protein functions. Looking ahead, I aim to develop computational tools that not only advance scientific understanding but also create meaningful impact on human health.
