I am a recent Computer Science graduate from Hacettepe University, currently based in London. I plan to continue my academic education next term, building on my diverse research interests. My areas of focus span graph theory, data management, natural language processing, bioinformatics, computer vision and pattern recognition. I am passionate about exploring the intersections of these fields and advancing my expertise through both academic and practical work.
