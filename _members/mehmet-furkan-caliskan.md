Currently 3rd year Artificial Intelligence Engineering student at Hacettepe University. 
I have a special interest in artificial intelligence, with particular focus on neural networks, computer vision, and natural language processing. 

In this lab, I am working on a project that uses Vision Transformers to predict molecular binding affinity. My research interests span across various AI domains, exploring how different architectures can solve complex biological and computational problems.
