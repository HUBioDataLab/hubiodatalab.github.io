I am a PhD candidate and research/teaching assistant at Hacettepe University Computer Engineering. I received my BS and MS in Computer Engineering from Hacettepe University.

My research interests lie in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and computational biology, with a particular focus on generative modeling and bioinformatics. I am passionate about developing data-driven methods that contribute to both scientific discovery and real-world applications.
