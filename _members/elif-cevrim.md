I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Bioinformatics at the Graduate School of Health Sciences, Hacettepe University. I completed my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Biomedical Engineering at TOBB University of Economics and Technology. My research interests include biomedical data science, drug design and development, structural bioinformatics and graph representation learning, with a particular focus on hypergraphs. 

My thesis focuses on applying AI-driven approaches to biological data to uncover complex relationships, such as those underlying disease mechanisms. I also work on projects in structural bioinformatics, where I apply computational approaches to analyze and compare biomolecular structures in the context of drug discovery. These efforts reflect my broader goal of supporting medical innovation and improving human health.
