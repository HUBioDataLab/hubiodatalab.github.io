I am a second-year PhD student in the HuBioDataLab and the Bioinformatics Department at Hacettepe University. My research focuses on generative models for drug design, particularly using graph neural networks, GANs, and large language models, with notable contributions including DrugGEN and Prot2Mol. I also work on molecular property prediction with transformer networks and CNNs, contributing to models such as SELFormer and DEEPScreen2. Beyond modeling, I have been involved in knowledge graph construction projects, including CrossBarV2 and OmniPath.

In parallel with my PhD, I work as a Machine Learning Researcher at DeltaWave (France), where I develop LLM agents to automate drug discovery and design pipelines through intelligent decision-making systems.
