Currently 3rd year Computer Engineering student at Hacettepe University.
I have a **special interest in LLMs** and what they can achieve. 


Working on generating artificial protein sequences that can mimic the function of the DNMT family. Trying to do that by utilizing an architecture
that integrates Transformers into a GAN setup.
