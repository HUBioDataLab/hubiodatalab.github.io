I am a third-year Electrical and Electronics Engineering student at Middle East Technical University (METU). I am currently part of the MIND (Molecular Intelligence) project, where I work on developing advanced machine learning models for molecular understanding. My main research interests include Natural Language Processing (NLP), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Computer Vision. I enjoy combining these areas to create intelligent and practical solutions that bridge scientific research and real-world applications.
