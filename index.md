# Hacettepe University Biological Data Science Laboratory

**Hacettepe Biological Data Science Lab**â€™s work focuses on developing machine/deep learning-based methods for: 
- the integration and representation of heterogeneous biomedical data,
- the prediction of the functional properties of genes/proteins,
- discovering/designing new drug candidate molecules.

We frequently utilise representation learning and generative artificial intelligence and have multiple ongoing projects focused on small-molecule and protein design.
