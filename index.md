# Hacettepe University Biological Data Science Laboratory

Hacettepe Biological Data Science Lab's work focuses on developing machine/deep learning-based methods for:
i. the integration and representation of heterogeneous biomedical data
ii. the prediction of the functional properties of genes/proteins
iii. discovering/designing new drug candidates

We frequently utilise representation learning and generative artificial intelligence. We have multiple ongoing projects focused on small molecule and protein design.
