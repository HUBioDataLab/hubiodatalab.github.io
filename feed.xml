<p>The seminar, titled “Harnessing Generative AI for Biomedical Discovery: Design, Integration, and Insight,” highlighted the Hacettepe Biological Data Science Laboratory’s efforts in using AI-driven methodologies to tackle modern biomedical challenges.</p>

<p>During the talk, Prof. Dr. Doğan introduced DrugGEN, the lab’s end-to-end graph-transformer-based generative adversarial network for designing target-specific drug candidate molecules. He noted that DrugGEN has successfully generated novel inhibitors for the AKT1 protein, which have been validated <em>in vitro</em>.</p>

<p>The presentation also briefly covered FlowProt, a classifier-guided flow-matching model for designing protein backbones, and CROssBARv2, a platform that unifies biomedical data into a queryable knowledge graph, enhanced with LLM-powered natural language interfaces.</p>

<p>Prof. Dr. Doğan, who leads the Hacettepe Biological Data Science Laboratory, was a postdoctoral researcher at EMBL-EBI and Cambridge University before his current role. His research focuses on developing machine and deep learning methods for biomedical data integration, functional prediction, and drug discovery. The seminar was hosted by Prof. Daisuke Kihara of Purdue University.</p>]]></content><author><name>research-news</name></author><category term="AI" /><category term="generative AI" /><category term="drug discovery" /><category term="bioinformatics" /><category term="seminar" /><category term="Hacettepe University" /><category term="Purdue University" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prof. Dr. Tunca Doğan, a faculty member at Hacettepe University’s Department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Engineering, delivered a presentation at the prestigious Purdue University Online Bioinformatics Seminar Series on October 23.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">DrugGEN Paper on Generative AI for Drug Design Published in Nature Machine Intelligence</title><link href="https://hubiodatalab.github.io/2025/10/21/druggen-nature-machine-intelligence.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="DrugGEN Paper on Generative AI for Drug Design Published in Nature Machine Intelligence" /><published>2025-10-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-25T19:54:24+00:00</updated><id>https://hubiodatalab.github.io/2025/10/21/druggen-nature-machine-intelligence</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://hubiodatalab.github.io/2025/10/21/druggen-nature-machine-intelligence.html"><![CDATA[<p>A paper detailing “DrugGEN,” a novel system for designing target-specific drug candidate molecules using generative AI, has been published in <em>Nature Machine Intelligence</em>, one of the world’s leading scientific journals for artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>The research was conducted by a team from the Hacettepe Biological Data Science Lab., led by Prof. Dr. Tunca Doğan from Hacettepe University’s Department of Computer Engineering and Head of the Institute of Informatics, Health Informatics A.B.D.</p>

<p>The DrugGEN system presents a novel architecture that, for the first time, integrates Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with graph transformer-based deep learning methods. This combined architecture leverages both the powerful feedback mechanism of GANs and the sophisticated modeling capabilities of graph transformers to automatically design <em>de novo</em> drug candidate molecules conditioned on a specific protein target.</p>

<h3 id="contribution-to-cancer-research">Contribution to Cancer Research</h3>

<p>In the study, the team targeted the AKT1 protein, which is associated with many different types of cancer. The AI designed thousands of potential molecules, five of which were synthesized and tested in the laboratory. Two of these molecules successfully suppressed the target protein at a significant level. Computational analyses, including attention maps and molecular dynamics, confirmed that the model was able to capture the intended target-specific interactions.</p>

<h3 id="why-it-matters">Why It Matters</h3>

<p>The study demonstrates that generative AI not only provides speed and cost advantages in the drug discovery pipeline but can also identify completely novel molecule candidates that have not been discovered before. This capability promises significant contributions to the development of new treatments for diseases.</p>

<p>In the interest of scientific transparency and public benefit, all code, pre-trained models, datasets, and result outputs have been made available via open access.</p>

<p>The research was led by Hacettepe University with participation from METU and Gazi University, and was supported by the TÜBİTAK 2247 National Leading Researchers Program. The study’s completion entirely within Turkey highlights the country’s capability for high-quality research at the intersection of generative AI and health.</p>

The project, named ‘DrugGEN’, not only aims to shorten the years-long drug development timeline but also to reduce its high costs. The research was published in <em>Nature</em>, one of the world’s most prestigious scientific journals.</p>

<p>The study, which began in 2021 and involved 11 faculty members, initially focused on developing treatments for liver cancer. Prof. Dr. Tunca Doğan of Hacettepe University’s Department of Computer Engineering explained the work.</p>

<p>“Our AI model can rapidly develop a molecule, provided that experts first tell us which protein, naturally found in our body, needs to be interacted with to treat the disease,” said Prof. Dr. Doğan. “We were inspired by large language models like ChatGPT. Just as language models produce a correct and meaningful answer to a question, our model generates molecules for a user-defined protein target.”</p>

<h3 id="successful-results-in-cancer-study">Successful Results in Cancer Study</h3>

<p>In their research, the team focused on liver cancer, based on expertise from METU’s Cancer System Biology Laboratory. “They told us which protein we should develop a molecule for based on their research data,” Doğan stated. “The AI then designed many molecules.”</p>

<p>After successful computational tests, the team moved to the experimental phase. “Out of the 5 molecules produced by the AI, two managed to bind to the protein,” Doğan reported. These molecules were then tested on laboratory cell lines, where they showed the same effect. Doğan noted that human trials are the next necessary, complex step.</p>

<h3 id="goal-reducing-15-years-to-2">Goal: Reducing 15 Years to 2</h3>

<p>Prof. Dr. Doğan highlighted the inefficiencies of current methods, where drug companies test massive libraries of molecules over long periods. “The time it takes for a single drug from its starting point to being available in a pharmacy is, on average, 15 years. Its current cost is around $2 billion.”</p>

<p>“With AI,” he continued, “we aim to reduce the pre-human trial period to 1-2 years and lower the cost, for example, to $1 million. We also want this to be a study that not only a few large pharmaceutical companies in the world can do, but for Turkey to be able to develop its own drugs.”</p>]]></content><author><name>research-news</name></author><category term="AI" /><category term="drug discovery" /><category term="generative AI" /><category term="Hacettepe University" /><category term="METU" /><category term="Gazi University" /><category term="Nature" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A collaborative project by scientists from Hacettepe, Gazi, and Middle East Technical University (METU) is using artificial intelligence to accelerate new drug development processes.
