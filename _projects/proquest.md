# ProQuest

Efficiently accessing and analyzing comprehensive biological datasets remains challenging due to traditional querying complexities. To address this, we developed an intuitive, scalable query interface using advanced large language models. Our system enables users, regardless of computational expertise, to formulate natural-language queries that automatically translate into precise Solr database searches, significantly simplifying interaction with UniProtKB. Additionally, we implemented a semantic vector search for rapid protein similarity analyses, using protein embeddings generated by ProtT5 protein language model within an optimized approximate nearest-neighbor search framework (Annoy). This method significantly outperforms conventional BLAST searches, offering a speed increase of up to tenfold on GPU hardware. Functional insights are further enriched through integrated Gene Ontology analyses, providing biologically meaningful context to similarity searches. Moreover, we incorporated a fully implemented Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework, which combines semantic, keyword, and full-text retrieval methods to provide context-aware, accurate answers. The module integrates embeddings (ProtT5, nomic-embed-text) with hybrid ranking strategies, and employs a custom algorithm to efficiently manage token limits, ensuring both completeness and reliability. Evaluations using diverse biological queries demonstrated the robustness of our interface, highlighting its ability to mitigate intrinsic variability in LLM outputs through controlled prompt engineering and query retry mechanisms. Overall, our novel project substantially streamlines the retrieval process, facilitating quicker, more accurate exploration of protein functions, evolutionary relationships, and annotations.
