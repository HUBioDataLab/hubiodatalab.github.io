Great news from our group! Our collaborative study with Erasmus University, focusing on drug development against the pox virus, has been accepted by the journal *Communications Biology*. Congratulations to Atabey and Elif for their contributions!

The study, "AI-driven discovery of the antiretroviral drug bictegravir and etravirine as potent inhibitors against monkeypox and related poxviruses," used an AI pipeline to identify these two existing drugs as potent inhibitors of MPXV and other poxviruses. This discovery supports their potential repurposing for treating mpox, especially for high-risk patients.
