Our team from Hacettepe University Biological Data Science Laboratory participated in the 17th International Symposium on Health Informatics and Bioinformatics (HIBIT 2024).

HIBIT, held since 2005, is an important conference that aims to create synergy between medical, biological, and information technology sectors. It provided a valuable platform for presentations and discussions on machine learning, deep learning, and bioinformatics topics that align with our laboratory's research areas.
