Our team from Hacettepe University Biological Data Science Laboratory participated in the 23rd European Conference on Computational Biology (ECCB 2024).

ECCB 2024, held in Turku, Finland, brought together scientists from a wide range of disciplines including computational biology, systems biology, bioinformatics, artificial intelligence, biology, and medicine. The conference focused on data and algorithms for health and science, providing an excellent platform for multidisciplinary collaboration.

The event featured top keynotes, talks, lively poster sessions, and exhibitions, offering our laboratory valuable opportunities to present our research in machine learning, deep learning, and bioinformatics while engaging with the European computational biology community.
