Our team from Hacettepe University Biological Data Science Laboratory participated in the International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) and the European Conference on Computational Biology (ECCB 2023).

ISMB/ECCB 2023, held in Lyon, France, is the largest and most high-profile annual meeting of scientists working in computational biology. This premier event provided an intense multidisciplinary forum for disseminating the latest developments in computational tools for data-driven biological research.

The conference offered an excellent opportunity for our laboratory to present our research in machine learning, deep learning, and bioinformatics, while engaging with the global computational biology community.
