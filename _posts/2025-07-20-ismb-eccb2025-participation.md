Our team from Hacettepe University Biological Data Science Laboratory participated in the 33rd International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) and the 24th European Conference on Computational Biology (ECCB 2025).

ISMB/ECCB 2025, held in Liverpool, UK, is the world's largest bioinformatics and computational biology conference. This premier event brings together researchers from computer science, bioinformatics, computational biology, molecular biology, mathematics, and statistics to share the latest advancements in computational methods for addressing biological problems.

The conference provided an excellent platform for our laboratory to present our research in machine learning, deep learning, and bioinformatics, while connecting with the global computational biology community.
